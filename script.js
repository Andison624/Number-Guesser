//2:Create an updateScore() function. This function will be used to correctly increase the winnerâ€™s score after each round.
  //2.1:Has a single parameter. This parameter will be a string value representing the winner.
  //2.2:Increases the score variable (humanScore or computerScore) by 1 depending on the winner passed in to updateScore. The string passed in will be either 'human' or 'computer'.
  //2.3:Does not need to return any value.

//3:Create an advanceRound() function. This function will be used to update the round number after each round. AdvanceRound() should increase the value of currentRoundNumber by 1. Than go to the game.js.
